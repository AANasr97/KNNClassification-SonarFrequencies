# KNN Project - Detecting Rocks or Mines with Sonar Data

Welcome to the KNN Project! In this project, we aim to create a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between rocks and mines based on the response of 60 separate sonar frequencies. The data set contains the response metrics for sonar frequencies sent out against a known minefield and known rocks. Our primary goal is to build a robust model for this classification task. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key components.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Description:
   - Explore the sonar data, including the features and labels (rocks or mines).
   - Understand the correlation between features using a heatmap.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Prepare the data for modeling by splitting it into cross-validation and test sets.
   - Standardize the features using the StandardScaler.

3. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:
   - Build a KNN classification model to distinguish between rocks and mines.
   - Utilize cross-validation to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, specifically the choice of K.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the KNN model's performance using a test set.
   - Generate classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy scores.

5. Visualization:
   - Plot the relationship between different K values and model accuracy to determine the optimal K.
